# Whitelips IDE

Whitelips is a development tool for [Whitespace programming language](http://compsoc.dur.ac.uk/whitespace/).
An online version can be found at http://whitespace.kauaveel.ee. This project started as a joke, like the language
Itself, and should not be taken too seriously (unless you want to contribute).


Whitelips features:
* Whitespace virtual machine,
* Whitespace optimizer,
* On-the-fly compilation,
* Local storage (browser) for programs (programs are never sent to the server),
* Whitespace assembly virtual machine and compiler to Whitespace,
* Disassebler,
* Debugging Whitespace and assembly programs,
* Whitespace syntax highlight,
* Example programs (including a Brainfuck [interpreter](https://github.com/vii5ard/brainfuck-whitespace)).
